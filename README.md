## Project Overview
This Data Analysis project aims to generate insight into the sales performance of a retail store over the past
one year. By analysing the various parameters in the data received we seek to gather key insight to make reasonable
decisions which then enable us to tell compelling stories around our data from the insight gotten and to know top-
selling products, regional performance, and monthly sales trends. The goal is to produce an interactive Power BI 
dashboard that highlights these findings.
